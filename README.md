# GameProject

This game is inspired by my love of the snake game(which is the reason why I still use an old Nokia phone).
My game is more about logic and less about reactivity and agility than the snake game.

  The aim of the game is to fill the board. You can’t go twice on the same square and you can’t go on the blue squares. Click on a white square to start the game. Use your keyboard arrows to move. There’s a timer. You reset it everytime you make a move. When the timer ends, you lose !You have three bonus when you start the game. You earn a bonus everytime you fill the board. 

I used Jquery quite a lot, actually I think it'd be quite long to do it in pure JS. The timer took me a lot of time (until I understood it's not possible to reset a CSS animation and that it would be much simplier to use a setInverval).
