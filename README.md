This game is inspired by my love of the snake game(which is the reason why I still use an old Nokia phone).
My game is more about logic and less about reactivity and agility than the snake game.

  The aim of the game is to fill the board. You can’t go twice on the same square and you can’t go on the blue squares. Click on a white square to start the game. Use your keyboard arrows to move. There’s a timer. You reset it everytime you make a move. When the timer ends, you lose !You have three bonus when you start the game. You earn a bonus everytime you fill the board.

I used Jquery quite a lot, actually I think it'd be quite long to do it in pure JS. The timer took me a lot of time (until I understood it's not possible to reset a CSS animation and that it would be much simplier to use a setInverval).

If you want to play, let met warn you about a few bugs I haven't fixed for the moment: once you've filled the board, you have to do one more move to let the script know that you're done. Otherwise, nothing happens, the time ends and you lose!
If you run out of time you can cheat: you just have to do an "empty" move and the time will reset.

Hope you'll like it!
